3. **Run Cypress Tests Locally**
   You can run the Cypress tests locally using:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```
   or to run in headless mode:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

## Usage
- The test specifications are located in the `cypress/integration/examples/actions.spec.js` file. You can add more tests as needed.
- The results of the tests, including detailed command logs, will be stored in the `cypress/results/detailCommandLogs` directory.

## GitHub Actions
